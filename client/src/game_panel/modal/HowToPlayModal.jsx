Specifically your odds are 5/4 whereby if you put $4 on you can get expect $5 back. If you're hosting and setting up the game, then it's opposite but overall, as long as you avoid training your AI with predictable patterns then the Profit Guarantee is similar to that of the Rock Paper Scissors game. A zero-sum game.

But with every profitable game, is it attractive enough to encourage the gamblers? Well, no - gamblers come to earn not learn. But like I said, as long as you know your stuff, you can guarantee profit for those times when you're desperately low and need to rely purely on what you know. Besides, not every Brain Game has to be so mentally intensive, have fun in the creation process.

                      <p>If you're setting up a Mystery Box AI, it can take some skill to master. Without a bit of practice, your AI can be very unattractive to play with and worse it can go south quickly. Think of your boxes like the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game">Shell Game</a> as long as they think they always stand a chance, they will always play, and as long as you set it up right, you will always stand to make a profit. So here's an example of a well balanced game that has a positive EV (Estimated Value): 5 boxes, each costing $10.50 each to open, with one box containing a $50 prize. In this case, as long as your boxes cost more to open than the odds, you can guarantee an edge (a positive EV) and therefore will win money in the long run, if you can survive the short run.

                      <p>If you're hosting, the short answer is yes - one of the very few games that can always guarantee profit, just set your payout as low as possible, bearing in mind a lower payout makes a less attractive game (35 is minimum for gametype 1-10). But does that make it fair for both parties? Yes, like any standard casino game, the House is always at risk in the short-run, but as more players lose, their safety funds become more stable. If you're not hosting, invite the gang - split the risk!

                          The winner is determined by the following rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The winner receives 2x their Bet Amount. If both players choose the same, the round is a tie and no money or fees are taken.

                      <p>Although Rock-Paper-Scissors is often considered a game of chance, with PVP, players can use their skill and knowledge of psychology to try predict outcomes. For example, most will lead with Rock, most will alternate and most will definitely find difficulty in randomizing their choices. Knowing these traits for profit is just mind money. Oh, and if you're setting up a game try keep your EV as close to 0 as possible...wait actually - that means people can count and make better decisions for example if 7 Rocks and 5 Papers have been played in the last 15 turns, then you can bet a lot of money on playing scissors next as it likely be a tie or a W but only IF you can be confident their EV is 0. So hopefully that answers the question ;)

                        When we're talking cash, most of us would prefer betting on randomness (RNGs) to give us a level playing field. But in return, you have to give up some house edge. The downside of this, is that in the long-run you have to lose to pay for the casino's operating costs. But it doesn't have to be like this. If you think of any platform currently in operation, its users always do better in the long-run. Meaning, the more they use the app, the better their experience will be. So why should a casino be any different. RPS.GAME utilizes AI and PVP to make it beneficial for its users in the long-run without sacrificing the 'provably-fairness' experience like you would in traditional casinos. You set the odds, you create your own outcome. Decide what results you want, and let the AI do the work for you.

                      <h5>Markov</h5>
                      <p>Markov the 'mimicker' is a pattern prediction model whilst throwing in a bit of maths to prevent being too predictable. For example, if you feed Markov 'Rock', 'Paper, 'Rock', 'Paper' etc. it will still throw in some 'Scissors' so, yes Markov might be simple but its reliable.</p>
